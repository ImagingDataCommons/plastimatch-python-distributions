# cibuildwheel repair step for macOS wheels. The macOS counterpart of
# retag_linux_wheel.sh -- see that file for why the default repair tool (delocate) has
# nothing useful to do here.
#
# On macOS the wheel's platform tag comes from MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, which describes the
# environment the wheel was *built* in and not the minimum OS the *bundled binary* supports.
# Those are independent: the binaries are compiled by a separate workflow, possibly on a
# different runner image. Setting the variable by hand works right up until the build layer
# lowers its deployment target and nobody remembers to lower this one too, at which point the
# wheels quietly exclude the users the change was meant to reach.
#
# So read LC_BUILD_VERSION out of the Mach-O binaries and tag the wheel to match.
#
# Usage: retag_macos_wheel.sh <wheel> <dest_dir>
